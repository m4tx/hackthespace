You need a break. Hacking can be exhausting, I know. You reach for your headphones and the memory of a recent tragedy strikes you. You crossed the line with spacewalking this time, which resulted in not getting paid enough to prolong your subscription on Galaxify. Youâ€™re infuriated as it is unacceptable and should be punished by law if you were to decide. Unfortunately you're not, and you're addicted to this thing since music became not only audible, but also visual experience, and now you're stuck with the one and only song you've managed to download. It will be a sad, long month.
