Congratulations! You’re the first space pirate ever to join Academic IT Festival! The journey was hard, so be proud of yourself. Your crew finally have a chance to gain some knowledge and actually help you with your work. You’ll fix the autopilot, and with all the new technology you’ll be almost invincible! You also got your Galaxify subscription back and temporary permission for spacewalks. Knowing that I won’t say see you soon but... Well done!
