# vigenere: `dramaticvinegar/`

The page contains a weird-looking long text and a picture with a space pirate
holding a bottle with vinegar in their left hand.

The vinegar is obviously a hint — googling `vinegar cipher` auto-corrects the
search query to `vigenere cipher`, which is what was used to encrypt the text.
There are several ways to decrypt it:

* One could guess that the text is just taken from the
  [SFI "About us" page](https://sfi.pl/en/about-sfi/), and go letter-by-letter
  to obtain the key used to encrypt the text,
* Standard Vigenère cipher breaking methods, like Kasiski's test and frequency
  analysis also give good results.
  
The key used is `ABSOLUTELYCOOL`.
