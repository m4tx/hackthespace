Since the computer guy got floated into space for that intern incident, you're the one in charge of all programmable things. Good for the rest of the crew, some of these savages act like they've never touched Quantum Bi-Polar Core, not so good for you though. Seeing the mess left by the previous guy you'd have floated him yourself. Now you don't have a choice but to scavenge through all his files to check if there's something important there. You doubt it though.
