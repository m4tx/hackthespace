It’s weird. It seems like you’ve just found information about some... secret event? None of your crew has ever heard about it. Yet you have just read a full description of it, and now this picture… You have a feeling that they’re connected, and you’re determined to find out what exactly it is. Especially given the fact that it’s the only way for you to spacewalk again, and spacewalking… Spacewalking is a life changing experience. It really helps you realize how small you actually are in the perspective of the universe. But remember, sometimes the smallest, least significant things can be the key to stepping up your game… Be careful, some of them are not what they seem to be.
