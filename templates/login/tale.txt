Congratulations, you’ve earned yourself your very first boarding party! Before you joined your crew you understood boarding ships quite literally, but that was a long, long time ago. You now know that you're no savage - and that a little bit of hacking can give you more profit than any violent battle. Captain gave you the target - your job’s to do the hacking.
