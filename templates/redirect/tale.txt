You thought it would be easier, didn't you? Don't be so head and shoulders above other people and maybe next time ask for help? Two heads are always better than one, you know. Anyway, I know that you're not the type to keep your head down so you'll probably keep trying since it's just a game, and games should be fun, and banging your head against a brick wall is certainly not. There must be something more to it, and I'm sure you'll get your head around it.
