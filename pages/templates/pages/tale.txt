You've successfully boarded enemy's ship! The last puzzle wasnâ€™t so obvious, I know. Well done! Before you joined your crew you understood boarding ships quite literally, but that was a long, long time ago. You now know that you're no savage - and that a little bit of hacking can give you more profit than any violent battle. You managed to get the access to enemy's files - can you find the information needed to plan your next move?
