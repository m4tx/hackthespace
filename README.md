It is recommended to use `virtualenv`.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp hackthespace/settings/local_settings.py{.example,}
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py generate_assets
python manage.py runserver
```


## Deployment

Use `production_settings.py.example` as the settings base. Remember to
compile the SCSSes before collecting the static files:

```

Then, use standard methods of deploying Django apps, e.g. using uwsgi
and nginx.
